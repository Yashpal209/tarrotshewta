                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Life often moves so fast that we forget to pause and nurture ourselves. Over time, stress, emotional pain, and unresolved energy begin to weigh us down. You may feel tired, anxious, disconnected, or stuck, not just physically but emotionally and spiritually too.</p>
                    <p>At Tarrot with Shweta, our healing sessions are designed to gently guide you back to a place of inner harmony. Through intuitive energy work and spiritual guidance, Shweta creates a safe and sacred space where true transformation can begin.</p>

                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Everything in this universe, including our bodies, is made up of energy. When our energy is blocked or imbalanced, it can manifest as physical illness, emotional distress, or mental confusion. Healing is not just about curing symptoms but restoring the flow of energy to its most natural state.</p>
                    <p>Shweta combines a variety of techniques such as Reiki, chakra balancing, aura cleansing, and intuitive healing to cleanse energetic blocks and activate the body’s natural ability to heal itself.</p>
