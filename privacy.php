                <p>Among them are:</p>

                </ul>

                <p>Information obtained anonymously is not considered "personally identifiable information." It also
                    excludes broad demographic information obtained from site visitors or clients without identifying
                    them.</p>

                <p>Tarrot with Shweta only gathers the following information from consumers who are able and willing to do
                    business with us:</p>

                </ul>

                <p><b>Important Note:</b> Although we collect personal financial information about you on our websites, such
                    as your credit card number, debit card number, or bank account number, we never have access to, collect,
                    or archive this information because it is collected directly by the financial institution like payment
                    gateways authorized to process your credit or debit card.</p>

                </ul>

                <p>No personally identifying information (PII) or data is ever gathered from site users who visit the
                    website just to evaluate its content and resources. The major reason for gathering personally
                    identifiable information is to do business. Never will personal information be sold, transferred, or
                    traded with a third party. Customers are required to disclose this personally identifiable information
                    to Tarrot with Shweta only after reading and comprehending the Terms of Use, Contract Statements, and
                    other necessary information available on this website. It is fully disclosed to the administrators of
                    this website.</p>

                <p>All site users' basic NPII (Non-personally identifying information) is gathered in an automated manner
                    and includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Method of access to the website</li>

                    <li>Landing and exit pages of the site used by visitors and customers</li>
                    <li>Information about visitors' and customers' locations</li>
                    <li>The time zone and local time of site visitors and customers</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Personal Information May Be Processed By External Entities</h2>

                <p>In addition to Tarrot with Shweta, third-party service providers and service vendors such as banking
                    institutions, credit card companies, credit card processors, clearinghouses, and other authorized
                    financial entities are authorized to collect this information from our customers on our behalf for
                    business to be conducted smoothly and professionally. We regrettably have no direct control over how
                    these third parties use personal information. We do, however, request (in writing) that they disclose
                    how they utilize the information submitted to them by our clients. We also utilize personally

                    notify them about the site's incentives and promotional activities.</p>

                <p>Site users and customers have several ways to opt out of all transactional agreements that entail the
                    transmission of sensitive information. Visitors and customers can utilize the "unsubscribe" link to
                    opt-out of any future communications. They can also opt-out of future messages by following the
                    instructions included in the e-mail correspondence. Communication of this type may take the form of
                    the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>E-mail solicitations urging you to join up for a specific service based on a membership
                        subscription</li>

                    information is only accessible to authorized entities. The website has implemented several reducing
                    practices and techniques to assure that personal information is not abused, transferred, or sent
